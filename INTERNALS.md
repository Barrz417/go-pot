# Go - Pot Internals
Go pot as the names suggests is surprisingly ü•Å... written in go! It is a HTTP tarpit made up of a few different components.

## Components
Go pot is made up of a few different components that come together to make the staller. Some of the more idiomatic components are:
* **Staller**: A http handler that will stall for a request for a given amount of time. It gets a generator instance it will keep on calling for new data until just before the timeout it has been given is reached. At which point it will correctly terminate the response.
* **Generator**: A generator will provide an infinite stream of fake structured data. That can be serialized into a number of different formats.
* **TimeoutWatcher**: The timeout watcher will keep track of how long a bot is willing to wait for a response. It will do this by watching when a given IP address disconnects. If it gets a few similar disconnects in a row it will assume that that is the maximum time a bot is willing to wait for a response and then give a time just under that to the staller.
* **Cluster**: The cluster is a way of sharing information about how long bots are willing to wait for a response to other nodes in the cluster. It uses memberlist (go)
* **Recast**: Recast is a way of restarting / reallocating IP addresses to avoid being blacklisted by connecting clients. It uses telemetry to see if stalling connections and moves to a different IP block if not.
