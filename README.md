A HTTP tarpit written in Go designed to maximize bot misery through very slowly feeding them an infinite stream of fake secrets.

## Features
- **Realistic output**: Go pot will respond to requests with an infinite stream of realistic looking, parseable structured data full of fake secrets. `xml`, `json`, `yaml`, `hcl`, `toml`, `csv`, `ini`, and `sql` are all supported.
- **Intelligent stalling**: Go pot will attempt to work out how long a bot will wait for a response and stall for exactly that long.

## Installation
Go pot is distributed as a standalone go binary or docker image. You can download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/ryanolee/go-pot/releases). Docker images are available on the [ghcr.io registry](https://github.com/ryanolee/go-pot/pkgs/container/go-pot).
